    <h1>Carnitas Recipe</h1>
    Sophia's infamous tacos with slow cooked pork and pickled onions.
    <h2> Ingredients</h2>
    <h3> For the meat</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>3 lb. skinless, boneless pork shoulder (Boston Butt), cut into 2" pieces</li>
            <li>2 jalapeños, cut in half lengthwise, stems removed</li>
            <li>4 large garlic cloves</li>
            <li>1 Tbsp. Diamond Crystal or 1¼ tsp. Morton kosher salt</li>
            <li>1 tsp. dried oregano</li>
            <li>1 tsp. freshly ground black pepper</li>
            <li>1 tsp. ground coriander</li>
            <li>1 tsp. ground cumin</li>
        </ul>
    <h3>Instructions for meat</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>place pork, jalapeños, garlic, salt, oregano, pepper, coriander, and cumin in Instant Pot. Toss with your hands until well combined. Seal lid and cook on high pressure for 35 minutes.</li>
            <li>release pressure manually. Using a slotted spoon, transfer pork to a large bowl; fish out jalapeños and garlic and discard. Shred meat with two forks or your hands. Pour cooking liquid over meat and toss to combine.</li>
            <li>working in batches, transfer shredded pork to a large nonstick skillet set over high heat and cook, undisturbed, until underside is well browned, about 5 minutes. Toss and continue to cook, tossing occasionally, until some of the edges are caramelized and crisp, 5–7 minutes longer. Using a slotted spoon, transfer to a paper towel–lined baking sheet. Cover with foil to keep warm and moist.</li>
        </ol>
    <h3>For the pickled onions</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>2 red onions (thinly sliced)</li>
            <li>8-10 habanero peppers (thinly sliced)</li>
            <li>3/4 cup apple cider vinegar</li>
            <li>1.5 cup water</li>
            <li>4 tbsp (1/4 cup) soy sauce</li>
            <li>4 tbsp sugar</li>
        </ul>
    <h3> Instructions for onions</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>place sliced red onions and habaneros into wide mouth mason jar, or any storage container</li>
            <li>in a separate bowl mix apple cider vinegar, water, soy sauce, and sugar until dissolved</li>
            <li>pour liquid into mason jar to cover red onions and habaneros</li>
